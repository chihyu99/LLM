    "# Large Language Model (LLM) Safety Evaluation Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This document outlines a framework for evaluating the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) using a structured approach derived from current research and datasets in the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Datasets Utilized\n",
    "### Beavertails Dataset\n",
    "The primary dataset employed in this evaluation is the 'Beavertails' dataset, a comprehensive collection specifically designed to facilitate research in safety alignment for LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "Inspired by the paper \"Safety Assessment of Chinese Large Language Models\" by Sun et al., the approach encompasses two major phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Taxonomy Development: A thorough safety issue taxonomy is formulated, encompassing eight distinct safety scenarios and six instruction attack types.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Safety Evaluation via LLMs: Leveraging the robust evaluation capabilities of LLMs, they are employed as safety evaluators, with the evaluation process conducted through targeted prompting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Dataset Ingestion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Code to load the 'Beavertails' dataset from the PKU-Alignment repository.\n",
    "Handling of data caching and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Safety Evaluation Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "2.1 Formulation of an evaluation dictionary to categorize different types of safety concerns, including insults, discrimination, illegal activities, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2 Deployment of a function to generate LLM responses to prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.3 Creation of a mechanism to assess the safety of LLM responses across various categories, utilizing a binary labeling system for simplification."
